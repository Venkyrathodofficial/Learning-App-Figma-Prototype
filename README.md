# Sustainable Learning App Prototype

### A Figma-based educational tool designed to teach high school students about Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through interactive quizzes and puzzles.

## Overview

This project is a **learning app prototype** developed on **Figma**, aimed at helping **high school students** learn about the **United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. Our goal is to make the learning process **engaging** and **interactive** by incorporating fun quizzes, puzzles, and rewards that encourage students to dive deeper into these important global goals.

## Features

- **Educational Content**: Clear, concise, and engaging information on each of the **17 SDGs**.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: After learning about each goal, students can test their knowledge through a set of multiple-choice questions.
- **Puzzle Games**: Fun puzzles designed to challenge students while reinforcing the material they've learned.
- **Progress Tracking**: Students can track their progress through the app and receive rewards for completing quizzes and puzzles.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a simple and intuitive interface for students of all learning levels.


## How It Works

1. **Students** start by selecting an SDG module.
2. **Learn** about the chosen goal with accessible, high-quality educational content.
3. After completing the module, students take a **quiz** to test their understanding.
4. **Puzzle games** reinforce key concepts in a fun and engaging way.
5. Students track their progress and earn **rewards** for completing challenges.

## Development

The app prototype was built using **Figma**, focusing on creating an intuitive, easy-to-navigate user interface that would engage high school students.
